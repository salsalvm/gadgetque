# gadgetque

Hi connections💛...

I completed another project in Flutter. It’s an E-commerce Mobile application “ GadgetsQue ” you can purchase gadgets in my application. Datas are coming from backend node.Js. datas are stored in Mongo db database (no sql). Datas are Integrated with Rest Api’s using dio package. I have used two method for payment gateway. first one is COD and next one is Razor-pay, both payment methods is available with 100% security. State are managed with Get package inside Gets state management. So it’s very easy to manage any state and we can implement very easily.I have followed Agile model with Scrum methodology. I have followed with MVC folder architecture so any third person can easily understand our source code. A bottom navigation bar with 4 page is also available ( home , order , address, profile ).
